# **Ilham Nauval Andrika - Data Analyst / Data Scientist**

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello and welcome!**

Iâ€™m *Ilham Nauval Andrika*, an economics graduate with a strong interest and passion for transforming data into valuable insights. To pursue this interest, I decided to switch careers and joined the Hacktiv8 Full-Time Data Science Bootcamp, where I learned the roles and required skills of Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers. Iâ€™m now eager to kickstart my career by applying my skills in an entry-level Data Analyst role.
